Thank you for trying 
Cloudflare Tunnel. Doing 
so, without a Cloudflare 
account, is a quick way 
to experiment and try it 
out. However, be aware 
that these account-less 
Tunnels have no uptime 
guarantee, are subject to 
the Cloudflare Online 
Services Terms of Use (htt
ps://www.cloudflare.com/we
bsite-terms/), and 
Cloudflare reserves the 
right to investigate your 
use of Tunnels for 
violations of such terms. 
If you intend to use 
Tunnels in production you 
should use a pre-created 
named tunnel by 
following: https://develop
