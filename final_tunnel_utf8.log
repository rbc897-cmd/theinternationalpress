INF Thank you for 
trying Cloudflare 
Tunnel. Doing so, 
without a Cloudflare 
account, is a quick 
way to experiment 
and try it out. 
However, be aware 
that these 
account-less Tunnels 
have no uptime 
guarantee, are 
subject to the 
Cloudflare Online 
Services Terms of 
Use (https://www.clou
dflare.com/website-te
rms/), and 
Cloudflare reserves 
the right to 
investigate your use 
of Tunnels for 
violations of such 
terms. If you intend 
to use Tunnels in 
production you 
should use a 
pre-created named 
tunnel by following:
